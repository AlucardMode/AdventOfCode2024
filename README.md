# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions in C

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges, written in C.

## Structure

Each day's challenge has its own directory, named `Day01`, `Day02`, and so on. Inside each directory, you will find:

- `main.c`: The C source file containing the solution.
- `input.txt`: The input data provided by the challenge.
- `Makefile`: A makefile for compiling the solution.

## Running Solutions

To run a solution, navigate to the directory of the day and use the make command:

```bash
cd Day01
make
./solution
